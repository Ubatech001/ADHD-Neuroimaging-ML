# ADHD-Neuroimaging-ML
Machine learning model to classify ADHD vs. non-ADHD using ADHD-200 neuroimaging dataset

## Project Overview
This project uses the **ADHD-200 dataset** to build a machine learning model that classifies individuals as **ADHD** or **non-ADHD** based on structural and functional MRI features. The motivation behind this project is to combine personal experience with ADHD and data science skills to explore predictive modeling for ADHD diagnosis and contribute to digital mental health research.

## Motivation
ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that often goes undiagnosed, leading to significant challenges in education, social interactions, and mental health. This project aims to apply **machine learning and neuroimaging analysis** to improve early detection and understanding of ADHD patterns in brain activity.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [ADHD-200 Preprocessed Connectomes Project (PCP)](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/)
- **File used:** `ADHD-200.deobliqueFix.tar`
- **Content:** Structural MRI, resting-state fMRI, and behavioral assessments from children and adolescents with ADHD and healthy controls.
- **Preprocessing:** Data has been corrected for oblique slice orientations and is ready for feature extraction.

---

## Methods
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loading MRI data and extracting relevant features.
   - Handling missing values and normalization.
   - Converting neuroimaging data into machine-readable matrices (connectivity, volumetric features).

2. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
   - Cross-validation to ensure model generalizability.
